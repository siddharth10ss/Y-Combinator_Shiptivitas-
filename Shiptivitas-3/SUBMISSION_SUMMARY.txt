✓ Three actionable ideas with hypothesis, impact, and description

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. Kanban Board Feature Impact:
   - Before Feature: 3.63 avg daily active users
   - After Feature: 11.79 avg daily active users
   - Impact: +224% increase in DAU

2. User Engagement:
   - Feature release: June 2, 2018
   - 110 days before, 245 days after analyzed
   - Minimum DAU after (5) > Average DAU before (3.63)

3. Card Activity:
   - Most active card: 5 status changes
   - Average: 2-3 changes per active card
   - Users actively managing workflows

SQL QUERIES PROVIDED
--------------------

------------------------
1. Analytics Dashboard (highest ROI, uses existing data)
2. Notifications (creates engagement loop)
3. Quick Actions (optimizes for power users)

DATA VISUALIZATIONS
-------------------
Generated CSV files for graphing:
- daily_active_users.csv (355 rows)
- card_status_changes.csv (200 rows)

Graph specifications provided in README_GRAPHS.md
Python script provided: generate_graphs.py

DELIVERABLES
------------

7. card_status_changes.csv - Data export for Graph 2

SUCCESS METRICS
---------------
Primary KPI: Daily Active Users
- Current: 11.79
- Target: 15+ (27% increase)

Secondary KPIs:
- Session frequency per user
- Cards created per user per day
- Status changes per day
- 30-day retention rate

METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Analyzed login_history table (100 users, 355 days)
2. Analyzed card_change_history table (200 cards)
